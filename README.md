# ☕ Dirty Café Sales - Data Cleaning & Analysis Project

## 📊 Overview

This project explores and cleans a dataset called **Dirty Café Sales**, originally found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedmohamed2003/cafe-sales-dirty-data-for-cleaning-training/data). The dataset contained inconsistencies and required preprocessing before meaningful analysis could be performed. 

The goal of this project was to:

- Clean and preprocess the data
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Create visualizations using Python
- Build a dashboard in Excel for further insights

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation
  - `matplotlib` for data visualization
- **Excel**
  - Interactive dashboard using pivot tables and charts
- **Jupyter Notebook** for code and EDA
- **Git & GitHub** for version control

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

The original dataset had issues such as:

- Missing values
- Inconsistent formatting
- Duplicated rows
- Incorrect data types

All these were addressed using Python scripts, with detailed explanations in the notebook.

---

## 📈 Data Analysis

After cleaning, the dataset was analyzed to answer key business questions like:

- What are the top-selling products?
- How does sales performance vary over time?

These insights are presented in the notebook along with accompanying visualizations.

## 📊 Excel Dashboard

An Excel dashboard was also created to provide a business-friendly overview of the sales data. It includes:

- Monthly sales trends
- Product category performance
